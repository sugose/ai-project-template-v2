# Changelog

All notable changes to [PROJECT NAME] are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Operational lessons from a live fomo-f session folded into docs/BACKLOG.md
  and memory/standards.md: mandatory `.gitattributes` line-ending policy in
  PBI-1.1 scaffolding, Chrome PR-fetch cache-busting note in PBI-2.2, a
  refined PBI-4.1 finding (file writes and git ops are separate
  capabilities), and a Review Standard addition on verifying claims
  directly rather than via proxy signals (PR #14)
- Clarified that the `?i=N` PR-URL cache-busting param is Clead's own
  fetch-time responsibility, not something Crog needs to add when
  reporting URLs (docs/BACKLOG.md wording fix) (PR #16)
- Added PBI-P.1 (document the change-control model Adam stated
  2026-07-23) and PBI-P.2 (fix stale changelog.yml wording) to the
  backlog under a new "Process & team documentation" section (PR #17)
- Fixed the stale "push to main" wording in the automated
  changelog-reminder comment in .github/workflows/changelog.yml (now
  reads "Crog: open a PR updating CHANGELOG.md"); closed PBI-P.2 (PR #18)
- Committed two working-tree-only edits carried over uncommitted from a
  2026-06-28 Cowork-Clead session — a GitHub-connector-availability
  check added to CLAUDE.md's session startup routine, and a matching
  session-notes entry in memory/context.md (PR #19)
- Added the "Clean session end state" checklist to CLAUDE.md — six
  criteria for verifying (not assuming) a session is genuinely closed
  out: no uncommitted changes, every PR resolved and independently
  verified, every follow-up persisted in the repo, direct (not
  pattern-matched) verification, CHANGELOG.md currency, and grounded
  "no open items" claims (PR #21)
- Added docs/NEXT_SESSION.md (staging area for plan-adaptation reasoning
  not yet mature enough to be a PBI, decision, or formal doc update) and
  wired it into CLAUDE.md's session-start routine plus a graduation-rule
  note under "Session end" (PR #22)
- Amended PBI-1.1 to require docs/NEXT_SESSION.md as mandatory day-one
  scaffolding for projects derived from this template, same tier as the
  `.gitattributes` requirement (PR #23)
- Added four raw, unprocessed items to docs/NEXT_SESSION.md's "What
  needs adapting" section, verbatim as Adam gave them, awaiting future
  triage (PR #24)
- Fixed a stale claim in CLAUDE.md's "Clean session end state" section
  (item 3), which incorrectly said this template didn't have a
  NEXT_SESSION.md yet — updated to reference docs/NEXT_SESSION.md now
  that PR #22 added it (PR #25)
- Documented the Crog prompt delimiter convention (CROG PROMPT HH:MM #N
  format, session-unique incrementing ID) in docs/ROUTINES.md (PR #27)
- Closed out the pr_dump-in-PR-comments question in memory/decisions.md —
  confirmed not part of v2's review flow, not reintroduced (PR #28)
- Added "The PIN workflow" section to CLAUDE.md and a new condition 7
  ("Pin list is empty") to the Clean session end state checklist (PR #29)
- Triaged docs/NEXT_SESSION.md's 2026-07-23 raw items — Copi, pr_dump,
  Crog-prompt-indexing, and PIN-workflow questions each given a
  disposition (PR #30)
- Clarified the merge approval/execution split in memory/roles.md — Adam's act of requesting or pasting an already-presented, approved merge prompt is itself the approval; the mechanical click may be delegated to Crog or Clead (PR #31)
- Added CHANGELOG entries for PRs #27-#30 (this entry's own PR) (PR #32)
- Removed the resolved 2026-07-23 triage entries from docs/NEXT_SESSION.md now that all four items had a disposition (PR #33)
- Added a memory/decisions.md entry confirming doc-only changes can be committed directly via Chrome driving GitHub's web editor, with no Crog involvement (PR #34)
- Marked docs/BACKLOG.md PBI-4.1 confirmed — the Chrome-web-editor direct edit/commit/PR/merge path proven end-to-end (PR #35)
- Added an explicit "Change execution model" section to CLAUDE.md distinguishing Clead-direct doc-only changes from Crog-implemented code changes (PR #36)
- Added a "verify live state before asserting routing/authority/process facts" discipline to Clead's role rules in memory/roles.md, ported from local Cowork auto-memory so it persists in the repo (PR #37)
- Added a scope note to docs/ROUTINES.md clarifying it describes the Crog PR flow only, cross-referencing CLAUDE.md's Change execution model section for doc-only changes (PR #38)
