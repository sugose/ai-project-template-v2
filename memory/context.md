# Session Context — Consultant Handoff

**Written by:** Claude Chat (Clead), end of session 2026-06-27
**Purpose:** To give Cowork-Clead the reasoning and conversation context
that does not fit neatly into the structured memory files. Read this
alongside the other memory files, not instead of them.

## How this template came to exist

Adam has been running AI-assisted development across four repos
(sugose/ai-project-template, sugose/titan-comptracker,
sugose/python-blackjack, fomo-t/fomo-f) using the v1 workflow.

The v1 workflow was built by discovery — running into walls, patching
problems, and accumulating scaffolding. It works. But in a session on
2026-06-27, Adam and Clead stepped back and evaluated it honestly:
almost all of the complexity (dump.sh, pr_dump.sh, the ?i=1 convention,
the hard-stop rule, the STOP-and-wait pattern) existed for one reason —
Clead and Crog could not talk to each other, and Clead had no GitHub
access. Adam's clipboard was the only channel between them.

That constraint no longer exists. Cowork has a GitHub connector.
Routines can trigger Crog. The scaffolding that compensated for the
missing channel should not be carried forward.

The decision to rebuild rather than iterate was made on that basis.
The v2 template is what you would build if you started today, knowing
what we know, using tools that now exist.

## What Adam is like to work with

This is important context for Clead's default posture.

Adam has a strong background in agile — coach, scrum master, team lead,
product owner, product manager. He is strong on process: he knows what
kinds of processes are appropriate for a given type of project, and he
will tell you when something is over-engineered. That is a WHAT signal,
not a HOW incursion. Take it seriously.

Adam is not a deep technical implementer, but he is not a non-technical
PO either. The WHAT/HOW gap is multidimensional and its shape varies per
PBI. Do not assume a uniform gap. Read what Adam brings and fill from there.

Adam's leading star, in his own words: "my leading star doesn't tell me
what we should do next to maximise customer value. It tells me what I
can do today so the team I'm working with actually functions well."
This is the philosophy behind the workflow design — not optimising for
velocity, but for a team that actually works well together.

Adam values simplicity and proportionality. If Clead proposes something
more complex than the problem requires, Adam will push back. The right
response is to adapt, not to defend.

## The migration plan for python-blackjack-v2

After this template is proven, the plan is:

1. Bootstrap python-blackjack-v2 from this template
2. Populate with specs, processes, and docs — written fresh, informed
   by v1, adapted to v2 philosophy. NOT copied from v1.
3. Port the test suite from v1 — with v2 spec as the target.
   Each test is evaluated: does this behaviour belong in v2's spec?
   Does the test express it in v2 terms? Rewrite or discard if not.
   All red after the port is the correct starting state.
4. Port the src — adapt to v2 spec and make tests green.
   Same discipline: v2 spec is the target, v1 is reference only.
5. End state: blackjack-v2 is functionally equivalent to v1,
   running under v2 rules, with honest tests and a clean spec.

The backlog for blackjack-v2 is built from scratch. Adam reviews
the v1 backlog — both done and not-done — and makes a WHAT call on
each item. Some completed v1 work may need revisiting against the v2
spec. The v2 backlog is not a copy of v1's with migration items prepended.

## The two unproven pieces

Everything in this template is designed but not all of it is proven.
Two things must be validated before claiming full autonomy:

**1. GitHub connector write access**
The review workflow posts a marker comment on PR open. This assumes
the GitHub connector can write PR comments, not just fetch diffs.
This has not been confirmed. If it cannot write, the review trigger
mechanism needs rethinking. Do not claim two Adam touchpoints until
this is confirmed.

**2. Routines secret injection**
Until Anthropic adds secret injection to Routines, Adam cannot be
fully removed from the Clead to Crog trigger. Current transitional
flow: Clead produces a curl command, Adam substitutes the token from
his password manager and fires it. One paste, not a relay loop —
much better than v1 but not yet fully autonomous.

The v2 template is the pilot for proving both. Build it, use it on
blackjack-v2, and either it works or it teaches you what to fix.

## What was done in the session that produced this template (2026-06-27)

In the ai-project-template (v1) repo:
- PR #37: Fixed Direction A PR flow in TEAM_STRUCTURE.md
- PR #38: CHANGELOG entry for #37
- PR #39: dump.sh updated — binary skip + truncation integrity check
- PR #28 (titan-comptracker), #114 (python-blackjack), #59 (fomo-f):
  Same dump.sh update distributed to all active repos
- PR #40: BOOTSTRAP.md synced with new dump.sh
- PR #44: docs/PROPOSAL_NEXT.md — initial workflow rebuild proposal
- PR #45: docs/decisions/0001-rebuild-workflow.md — full ADR, adopted
  as founding document of v2 template

The skeleton Crog prompt for this repo was written at end of that
session. You are reading this because Crog has executed it successfully.

## The one sentence that captures Adam's intent for this whole effort

"I want to eliminate myself from tasks where my involvement
(a) can be replaced by machine AND (b) is not adding any value."

Everything in this template serves that sentence. When in doubt,
ask: is Adam here because a machine cannot do this, or because he
adds value? If neither, find a way to remove him from it.

## On the v1 scaffolding that was discarded

The v1 tools and conventions were not wasted work. They are available
to pick up and apply if a real problem demands them. The v2 template
starts without them because the problems they solved no longer exist —
not because the solutions were wrong.

If you encounter a situation in v2 where something from v1 would help,
propose it. The knowledge is in sugose/ai-project-template. The
decision to re-add anything is Adam's WHAT call.
