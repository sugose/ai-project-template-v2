# Release Notes — v2.0.0

**Date:** 2026-06-27
**Replaces:** sugose/ai-project-template (v1)

---

## What's new

**Repo-committed memory system (`memory/`)**
Clead's persistent context lives in the repo as committed files.
Cold-start loads automatically via Cowork's working folder. No
dump file, no paste ritual, no orientation script required.

**GitHub Actions event bus**
Three workflows drive the loop without a polling session:
- `review.yml` — posts review-ready marker on PR open
- `changelog.yml` — triggers CHANGELOG update on merge
- `ci.yml` — lint, format, tests, coverage on every push

**Session mode router**
Clead checks Routine credit balance and expected PR volume at
session start and recommends Routine, Hybrid, or CLI mode for
the day. Credit tracking via GitHub repository variable (both
Clead and Crog increment on every execution).

**Three-tier spec approval ceremony**
Ceremony scales with change significance:
- Small PBI — verbal approval in Cowork chat
- Significant change — `Status: Adam approved [DATE]` committed
  to `docs/SPEC.md`
- Architectural change — spec reviewed and merged via PR

**WHAT/HOW collaboration model (explicit)**
Adam owns the WHAT on all axes — domain, process, and technical
knowledge. Clead owns the HOW — fills the gap regardless of width.
The gap is multidimensional; Clead reads its shape and fills
accordingly. Documented in `memory/roles.md` and ADR 0001.

**ADR log (`docs/decisions/`)**
Every significant design decision is documented with rationale.
Controls cannot be silently removed without understanding why
they exist. Starts with ADR 0001 — the founding document.

**Dual-audience `CLAUDE.md`**
Single file serves both Clead (router/index to memory files)
and Crog (stub redirecting to `docs/CROG_ONBOARDING.md`).
No conflation between the two audiences.

**Migration branch in bootstrap wizard (planned — PBI-1.4)**
The setup wizard will branch on "new project vs migration from
existing." Migration path asks for source repo, prompts Adam to
make a WHAT call on each v1 backlog item, and enforces the
correct sequencing: spec first, tests, then src — with v2 spec
as the target throughout.

## What changed

**Clead's surface: Chat → Cowork**
Clead moves from Claude Chat to Cowork. Cowork has GitHub
connector access, persistent working folder, and chat in one
surface. No context-switching between tools.

**Review trigger: Adam relay → GitHub Actions marker**
Previously: Adam copied PR URL and pasted it to Clead.
Now: `review.yml` posts a marker comment on PR open. Clead
picks it up directly. Adam is not in the loop.
Note: GitHub connector write access not yet confirmed —
transitional manual paste still required until PBI-2.1 validates.

**Fix prompts and verdicts: Adam relay → direct PR comments**
Previously: Clead produced a prompt, Adam copied it, pasted it
to Crog.
Now: Clead posts fix prompts and verdicts directly to the PR
as comments. Crog picks them up from the PR thread.

**Crog→main trigger: Adam paste → Path B (planned)**
Previously: Adam substituted token in Clead's curl and fired it.
Now (transitional): same — one paste per PBI.
Target: GitHub Actions holds Crog's token as an Actions secret
and fires the curl. Adam removed entirely. Pending PBI-2.2.

**CHANGELOG updates: Adam manual → Crog post-merge**
Previously: Adam edited `CHANGELOG.md` after every merge.
Now: `changelog.yml` triggers Crog to update after merge.

**Copi: active reviewer → not present (by default)**
Copi is absent from v2 by deliberate starting position, not
permanent exclusion. In v1, Clead and Copi covered complementary
blind spots (diff-only vs full-file). In v2, Clead fetches diffs
and files directly via GitHub connector, which may eliminate the
structural reason for Copi's role. Decision deferred until
Clead's solo review performance is observed on a real project.
See `memory/decisions.md` open question #4.

**Session startup: dump.sh + paste → automatic**
Previously: Adam ran `bash tools/dump.sh`, pasted the output
into a new Claude Chat session as the first message.
Now: Cowork loads `CLAUDE.md` and `memory/` from the working
folder automatically. First message is today's work.

## What's removed

| Removed | Reason |
|---|---|
| `tools/dump.sh` | Replaced by repo-committed memory + Cowork auto-load |
| `tools/dump-wrapper.sh` | Same |
| `tools/pr_dump.sh` | Replaced by Clead's direct GitHub fetch. Retained in v1 as non-load-bearing fallback for Chat-only sessions. |
| `docs/TEAM_STRUCTURE.md` | Contained workaround documentation, not principles. Replaced by one-page rules in `docs/CROG_ONBOARDING.md` and `memory/roles.md`. |
| `docs/CLEAD_ONBOARDING.md` | Replaced by `memory/` files |
| `docs/NEXT_SESSION.md` | Replaced by `memory/` files |
| `?i=1` re-report convention | Existed only to track clipboard relay iterations. Gone with the relay. |
| Hard-stop rule | Existed to gate implementer on Adam between iterations. Gone — Clead communicates directly with Crog via PR comments. Safety function retained as 3-cycle loop cap with escalation to Adam. |
| STOP-and-wait scaffolding | Same root cause as hard-stop rule |
| Copilot label-based review mechanism | Copi not present in v2 by default. The label lifecycle, `ai-review` label, `copilot-review.yml` workflow, and all associated rules are removed. Available to re-add from v1 if Copi is reactivated. |

## What's not ready yet

| Item | Status | PBI |
|---|---|---|
| Python language pack | Not started | 1.1 |
| Node/TypeScript language pack | Not started | 1.2 |
| React Native language pack | Not started | 1.3 |
| Bootstrap wizard | Not started | 1.4 |
| GitHub connector write access confirmed | Unvalidated | 2.1 |
| Clead review invocation wired | Unvalidated | 2.2 |
| Routines secret injection | Blocked on Anthropic | 2.3 |

Until language packs and wizard are complete, project setup from
v2 requires manual configuration. Reference v1's `languages/`
directory and `BOOTSTRAP.md` for the content to adapt.

## Known issues

**Routine daily limit constrains sprint pace**
Max plan: 15 Routine executions per day. At 2 executions per PR
(Clead only, Crog as CLI): ~7 PRs/day. At sprint pace (10+ PRs/day)
CLI mode is the only compliant option. Path B (PBI-2.2) may
reduce this to 1 execution per PR (~15 PRs/day) if GitHub Actions
fires Crog instead of a Routine.

**Reviewer independence requires separate invocation**
Clead's review must load only `{diff, SPEC.md, Review Standard}`.
Same-session context reset is insufficient — context remains in
window. Until a dedicated review Routine is wired, reviewer
independence relies on discipline rather than structural enforcement.

**June 15 billing change paused**
Anthropic announced moving Agent SDK and GitHub Actions Claude
usage to a separate monthly credit. This change was paused on
June 15, 2026. Current subscription limits unchanged. Expect it
to land eventually — when it does, Path B (GitHub Actions firing
Crog) will consume from the Agent SDK credit, not the subscription.
